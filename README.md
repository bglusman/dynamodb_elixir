Dynamodb

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bglusman/dynamodb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bglusman/dynamodb)
[![Inline docs](http://inch-ci.org/github/bglusman/dynamodb.svg)](http://inch-ci.org/github/bglusman/dynamodb)

## Adapted (hopefully someday) from https://github.com/ericmj/mongodb

## Features

  * Supports DynamoDB local and AWS
  * Connection pooling
  * Streaming cursors
  * Performant ObjectID generation

## Immediate Roadmap

  * Add timeouts for all calls
  * Bang and non-bang `Dynamo` functions
  * Move BSON encoding to client process
    - Make sure requests don't go over the 16mb limit
  * Replica sets
    - Block in client (and timeout) when waiting for new primary selection
  * Reconnect backoffs with https://github.com/ferd/backoff
  * Lazy connect

## Tentative Roadmap

  * SSL
  * Use meta-driver test suite
  * Server selection / Read preference

## Data representation

    BSON             	Elixir
    ----------        	------
    double              0.0
    string              "Elixir"
    document            [{"key", "value"}] | %{"key" => "value"} *
    binary              %BSON.Binary{binary: <<42, 43>>, subtype: :generic}
    object id           %BSON.ObjectId{value: <<...>>}
    boolean             true | false
    UTC datetime        %BSON.DateTime{utc: ...}
    null                nil
    regex               %BSON.Regex{pattern: "..."}
    JavaScript          %BSON.JavaScript{code: "..."}
    integer             42
    symbol              "foo" **
    min key             :BSON_min
    max key             :BSON_max

* Since BSON documents are ordered Elixir maps cannot be used to fully represent them. This driver chose to accept both maps and lists of key-value pairs when encoding but will only decode documents to lists. This has the side-effect that it's impossible to discern empty arrays from empty documents. Additionally the driver will accept both atoms and strings for document keys but will only decode to strings.

** BSON symbols can only be decoded.

## Usage

### Installation:

Add dynamodb to your mix.exs `:deps` and `:applications` (replace `>= 0.0.0` in `:deps` if you want a specific version). If you want to use poolboy as adapter also add it to your mix.exs `:deps` and `:applications` (because poolboy is an optional dep in dynamodb):

```elixir
  def application do
    [
      applications:
      [
       # ... other deps
       :dynamodb,
       :poolboy # only needed if you want to use poolboy as adapter
      ]
    ]
  end

  defp deps do
    [
      # ... other deps
      {:dynamodb, ">= 0.0.0"},
      {:poolboy, ">= 0.0.0"} # only needed if you want to use poolboy as adapter
    ]
  end
```

Then run ```mix deps.get```.

### Connection Pools

```elixir
defmodule DynamoPool do
  use Dynamo.Pool, name: __MODULE__, adapter: Dynamo.Pool.Poolboy
end

# Starts the pool named DynamoPool
{:ok, _} = DynamoPool.start_link(database: "test")

# Gets an enumerable cursor for the results
cursor = Dynamo.find(DynamoPool, "test-collection", %{})

Enum.to_list(cursor)
|> IO.inspect
```

### Examples
```elixir
Dynamo.find(DynamoPool, "test-collection", %{}, limit: 20)
Dynamo.find(DynamoPool, "test-collection", %{"field" => %{"$gt" => 0}}, limit: 20, sort: %{"field" => 1})

Dynamo.insert_one(DynamoPool, "test-collection", %{"field" => 10})

Dynamo.insert_many(DynamoPool, "test-collection", [%{"field" => 10}, %{"field" => 20}])

Dynamo.delete_one(DynamoPool, "test-collection", %{"field" => 10})

Dynamo.delete_many(DynamoPool, "test-collection", %{"field" => 10})
```
